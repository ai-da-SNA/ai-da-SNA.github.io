## SNA software tools

A collection of detailed quantitative analyses on SNA frameworks and tools. The aim of this collection is to help newcomers selecting the most adequate technology for their goals and fostering new research in those dimensions where exists room for improvement.

## The Four Dimensions of SNA

In order to do a quantitative assessment of the tools four dimension have been defined: *Pattern and Knowledge discovery*, *Information Fusion and integration*, *Scalability*, and *Visualization*.

* *What can I discover?* This question is related to the different types of knowledge that the tool is able to extract. The goal of this question is to quantify the capacity of the tool to extract valuable knowledge from the data. To answer this question, the dimension *Pattern and Knowledge discovery* has been considered.

* *What is the limit?* Answering this question the community will understand the scalability of the tool. This question is quite important due to the amount of data that can be extracted from social networks. This question has been addressed through the *Scalability* dimension.

* *What kind of data can I integrate?* This relevant question, related to the capacity to integrate and fusion information from current SNA technologies, has been analysed through the *Information Fusion and Integration* dimension.

* *What can I show?* Finally, this last question was explored using the *Visualization* dimension, although there exist a large number of information visualization, and tools that provide flexible methods to visualize the information, this is still an open problem in the area.

### Disclaimer

We need to make a reflection on the dimensions and metrics proposed. What is proposed here is an initial work, derived from an intense dedication to the area of social network analysis in the last ten years. These dimensions, and the defined metrics (or degrees), cannot (and should not) be considered as the only ones that can be defined, even the definition cannot be considered as complete. From the analysis of the state of the art, we have selected those more relevant (from our perspective) features that could be used to better identify and reflect the state of these technologies. It is quite probable, that some highly relevant characteristics have not been considered by authors. We would like to encourage the community to provide its own evaluations, of both the tools that have been evaluated in this paper as well as others in which you have previous experience. This collaboration will promote the use of SNA technologies and fostering new developments, but it will not be possible without the cooperation of the community, so **your contribution will be highly appreciated**.
